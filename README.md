📘 What is CGPA?
CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) is a number that shows your overall academic performance. It is the average of your grade points in all subjects, considering how important (or how many credits) each subject is.

📏 How is CGPA Calculated?
Every subject gives you a grade (like A, B, C).

Each grade has a grade point (like A = 10, B = 8, etc.).

Each subject has credits (more important subjects usually have more credits).

Multiply the grade point × credits for each subject.

Add all those results together.

Divide by the total number of credits.
